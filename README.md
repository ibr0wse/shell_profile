# shell_profile
Command shortcuts I usually have in my shell profile. I'm always running these commands and wanted some quick aliases.. 

These aliases are either custom made from myself or modifed/copied from others, as mentioned in [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments). 

## Install
Save contents of .profile into your `.profile` for bash or `.zprofile` for zsh
