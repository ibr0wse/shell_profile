# shell_profile
Command shortcuts I usually have in my shell profile. I'm always running these commands and wanted some quick aliases.. 

These aliases are either custom made from myself or modifed/copied from others, as mentioned in [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments). 

## Setup
Save contents of `profile` into your `~/.bash_profile` for bash:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibr0wse/shell_profile/main/profile >> ~/.bash_profile
```
OR `~/.zprofile` for zsh:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibr0wse/shell_profile/main/profile >> ~/.zprofile
```
Reload shell after running one of the above commands.
